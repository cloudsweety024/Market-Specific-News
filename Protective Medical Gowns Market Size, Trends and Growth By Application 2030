In hospitals, these gowns are essential for preventing the spread of infections and protecting healthcare workers during surgical procedures. They are commonly used in operating rooms, emergency departments, and intensive care units, where the risk of exposure to contaminants is high. Hospitals prioritize the use of high-quality, disposable gowns to maintain a sterile environment and safeguard both patients and medical staff from potential cross-contamination. The demand for protective medical gowns in hospitals continues to rise due to increased awareness of infection control and stringent regulatory standards that govern healthcare practices.</p><p>Another critical application of protective medical gowns is in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes and assisted living centers. These environments require gowns to manage and prevent the spread of infectious diseases among residents who may have compromised immune systems.
